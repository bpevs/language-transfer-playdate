# Language Transfer for PlayDate (Unofficial mp3 player)

Basically, because I like using the physical keys for audio playback, so that I can pause/play the audio without looking at a screen.

compile: `pdc source/main.lua Language\ Transfer.pdx`

## Usage

Download pdx file and load it onto your console

copy audio from [language transfer](https://www.languagetransfer.org/free-courses-1#complete-spanish) and place in `com.bpev.language-transfer/courses/spanish/[each-tracks-filename].mp3`

Right now, it's hardcoded to spanish, but it should work with others if you rename the dir to `spanish`, and replace the name of each file with `Spanish` (so it looks like `Language Transfer - Complete Spanish - Lesson xx.mp3`)
